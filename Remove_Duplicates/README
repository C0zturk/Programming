Remove_Duplicates
#During an engagement at work I was required to extract logs from SNMP managed devices.  These logs were largely obfuscated and had many duplicate source and desination IP addresses.  I was required to identify unique source-destiantion IP's.  I created this script to simplify the process of identifying unique combinations.  The script is very straight forward - you specify the excel file that it should remove duplicates from on row 8 and it will spit out new excel file with the name of your choice - you can rename the file on row 34. Currently it works off of 2 columns (A & B) but will remove the duplicate in Column B - you can paste your data into these columns or condense your data into 2 columns in your own file to manipulate it to work for you.

How to use script:

Download the Code ZIP File.
If using the IP_Excel.xlsx file to remove duplicates from; paste the data you want duplicates remove from in Columns A/B in the .xlsx file.
If using your own file, open the Excel_editor.sln file and rename row 8 to the your filename.
Open .sln file and execute.
